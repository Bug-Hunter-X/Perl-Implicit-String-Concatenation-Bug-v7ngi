This example demonstrates a common error in Perl related to implicit string concatenation. When adding a number to a string, Perl concatenates the values rather than performing numerical addition. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. The solution shows how to explicitly convert the string to a number before the addition to get the expected numerical result.
